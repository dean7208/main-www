Files that I have created that will allow me to post family calendars from google, and also
post pictures from vacations, crusies, family reunions, etc.

I keep changing the way I am doing this and my latest attempt uses php to attmept o make
things simpler to do.  For example having a header, footer and vavigation that I can include
from a separate php fil, and not have that info copied to several ewb pages.

Tied doing it with javascript, but that was really complicated and required a lot of code per page.
